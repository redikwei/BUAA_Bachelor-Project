# Limit Cycle Analysis of Predator-Prey Models

This repository contains code and resources for the analysis of limit cycles in three-dimensional predator-prey models, based on the thesis "Limit Cycle Analysis of Predator-Prey Models: Algorithmic Analysis in Three-Dimensional Systems" by Wei Hongdu.

## Introduction
This project focuses on the study and algorithmic analysis of limit cycles in three-dimensional predator-prey models using mathematical modeling and symbolic computation.

## Usage
This project use MAPLE as a calculation tool.
